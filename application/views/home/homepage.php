	<p>Welcome to the Commission on Election and Appointment</p>
	<p>
	The Commission on Election and Appointment (CEA) website is seen as a valuable tool in 
	publicly disseminating up-to-date information on election-related developments concerning 
	the internal school elections.In keeping with the fast-changing pace of our time, the 
	Commission on Election and Appointment (CEA) continue in developing and enhancing the 
	accessibility and usability of its website having in mind the significance of sustaining the 
	right of the Student to information and access to public records. Needless to say, such right 
	goes hand in hand with CEA goal of improving the University of the Immaculate Conception 
	electoral processes towards strengthening its democratic ideals and aspirations.
	</p>
	<p>
	Through its website, the Commission on Election and Appointment (CEA) does not only seek 
	to inform the public but also to encourage them to be proactive. By way of example, the list 
	of SSG and Program Candidate ineligible to run for the February 26, 2014 SSG and Program Election 
	by reason of the next term aspiring leaders are posted in the website for everyone's scrutiny.
	</p>
	<p>Finally, I wish to convey to the public that the Commission on Election and Appointment (CEA) 
	is doing its best to give the highest measure of standards in providing their needed information 
	in the belief that a well-informed electorate makes a well-thought-of decision as to who shall 
	be elected leaders of our School.
	</p>
